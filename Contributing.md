# üëç Contributing
Contributions are very welcome, either of themes you've created yourself or just ones you've discovered online. Just open a Pull Request and it to the Table with a preview image and link to the page where the theme is hosted.  
If you're not sure how, just open an Issue with the link and preview image included, and I'll add it myself when I get the chance. 

Bear in mind, there are a few rules on what will be accepted:

* **The majority of elements must be changed from default:** Themes that consist of the default GRUB menu with just a background thrown in will not be accepted. In the least please try to include a custom background, menu selector and flavor text.
* **Forks of existing themes must be recognizably different from their original:** Altering an existing theme is an excellent way to learn without having to read through GRUB's sparse documentation. But if you wish to share an edited theme here, please ensure you've changed enough of it to stand out against the original. This page was created to make it easier to find unique themes, and that falls apart if every theme is a vague alteration to an existing one. Compare my CRT-Amber theme to the Fallout theme that it's forked from, for an example of how different it should be.
* **Theme must not be too similar to ones already on the page:** Similar to above, but even for completely custom themes. Though if your theme is significantly higher quality than the one it's similar to, it may be possible to replace the former.
* **No Waifu themes**: Anime related themes are fine, but please, no themes revolving entirely around generic renders of an anime character. Pling has hundreds of these in every category, not just GRUB. Again, Anime is fine, this is just a rule against themes that consist of a few fancy colours and a single cutout of an anime character.
* **SFW only**: You'd think this is obvious, but you'd be surprised! üò≥
